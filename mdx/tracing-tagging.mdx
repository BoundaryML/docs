title: "Tracing and tagging functions"

Gloo allows you to trace any request with the **@trace** decorator

In the example below, we trace each of the two functions `pre_process_text` and `full_analysis`:

```python
import pytest
from gloo_py.testing.pytest_gloo import gloo_test
from generated.functions import AnalyzeBook, ClassifySentiment
from generated.custom_types import Book, AuthorInfo
from gloo_py import trace


@trace()
async def pre_process_text(text):
    return text.replace("\n", " ")


@trace()
async def full_analysis(book: Book):
    # sentiment = await ClassifySentiment("v1", args=pre_process_text(book.content))
    book_analysis = await AnalyzeBook("v1", args=book)
    return book_analysis


@gloo_test
@pytest.mark.asyncio
class TestBookAnalysis:
    async def test_book1(self):
        content = """Before I could reply that he [Gatsby] was my neighbor...
        """
        processed_content = await pre_process_text(content)
        return await full_analysis(
            Book(
                title="The Great Gatsby",
                author=AuthorInfo(firstName="F. Scott", lastName="Fitzgerald"),
                content=processed_content,
            ),
        )
```

This allows us to see each function invocation, as well as all its children in the dashboard:

### Adding custom tags

The dashboard view allows you to see custom tags for each of the function calls. This is useful for adding metadata to your traces and allow you to query your generated logs more easily.

To add a custom tag, you can import **update_trace_tags(..)** as below:

```python
from gloo_py import update_trace_tags, trace
import typing

@trace()
async def pre_process_text(text):
    update_trace_tags(userId="1234")

    # You can also create a dictionary and pass it in
    tags_dict: typing.Dict[str, str] = {"userId": "1234"}
    update_trace_tags(**tags_dict) # "**" unpacks the dictionary
    return text.replace("\n", " ")
```
