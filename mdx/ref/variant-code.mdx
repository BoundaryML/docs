<Warning>This is an advanced feature. We caution against using it.</Warning>

This a way to use a heuristic inside of your pipelines. If you feel this is the
right choice, please reach out and ask first! You can read more about them [here](/mdx/ref/method#variant-code).

```gloo
@variant[code] my_code_example for GetSentiment {
    @method impl {
        @lang[py] {
            async def impl(arg: InputType) -> OutputType:
                # Some implementation
        }
    }
}
```

The `impl` method is a special method that is used to implement the heuristic.
You can import any library or run any code you want inside of it. The only
requirement is that it must take in the `InputType` and return the `OutputType`
as defined by `GetSentiment`.
