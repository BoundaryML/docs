If you're only looking for Gloo's **tracing** and **test suite** functionality, all you need is the Gloo SDK. If you want to use **Gloo Configs** to declare your LLM pipelines, you'll need to install the Gloo CLI and Gloo VSCode Extension, which will setup the Gloo SDK for you.

### Pre-requirements

Currently Gloo only supports Python.

For updates on Typescript release, feel free to reach out at contact@trygloo.com

## Create a Gloo Project in the dashboard

Visit [app.trygloo.com](https://app.trygloo.com) and create a new project. Skip this step if you don't want any dashboard functionality.

## Install the Gloo SDK

Skip this step if you want to use Gloo Configs. The Gloo CLI will install the SDK for you.

<CodeGroup>
```bash pip
pip install gloo-lib
```

```bash poetry
poetry add gloo-lib@latest
```

</CodeGroup>

## Install Gloo Config functionality

### Gloo CLI

First, install the gloo CLI -- `gloo` -- to your path. This CLI tool helps translate your `.gloo` files into Python code.

<CodeGroup>

```bash Mac
brew tap gloohq/gloo
brew install gloo
```

```bash Linux (debian)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GlooHQ/homebrew-gloo/main/install-gloo.sh | bash
```

```bash Windows (via scoop)
# You can install scoop at https://scoop.sh/
scoop bucket add gloo-bucket https://github.com/gloohq/homebrew-gloo
scoop install gloo
```

</CodeGroup>

### Update instructions

<CodeGroup>

```bash Mac
gloo update
```

```bash Linux (debian)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GlooHQ/homebrew-gloo/main/install-gloo.sh | bash
```

```bash Windows (via scoop)
scoop update
scoop update gloo
```

</CodeGroup>

## Gloo Extension

Use our [VSCode Exension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=gloo.gloo) for syntax highlighting, auto building `.gloo` files, and inline syntax errors.

<Info>It also works with [Cursor](https://cursor.so/)!</Info>

<Warning>
  If you don't use the VSCode extension, you'll need to run: `gloo build` (no
  args) every time you edit a `.gloo` file.
</Warning>

### Initialize Gloo in your project

```
gloo init
```

This will create a gloo.yaml file

![](/images/glooinit.png)

### Folder structure

```
.
|-- gloo.yaml
├── app
│   └── your application files
├── gloo
│   └── your gloo files live here
├── pyproject.toml
└── generated
    └── translated, runnable python code from .gloo.
          Don't edit these files.
```

Now you're all setup! Proceed to the [Running Tests](/mdx/running-tests) section to learn how to run your first test.
