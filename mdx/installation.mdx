You'll need to install the gloo compiler -- `gloo` -- to your path.

brew tap gloohq/gloo
brew install gloo
```


```bash Linux (debian)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GlooHQ/homebrew-gloo/main/install-gloo.sh | bash
```

```bash Windows (via scoop)
# You can install scoop at https://scoop.sh/
scoop bucket add gloo-bucket https://github.com/gloohq/homebrew-gloo

```
</CodeGroup>

### Update instructions

<CodeGroup>

```bash Mac
gloo update
```


```bash Linux (debian)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GlooHQ/homebrew-gloo/main/install-gloo.sh | bash
```

```
</CodeGroup>


## Gloo Extension

Use our [VSCode Exension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=gloo.gloo) for syntax highlighting, auto building `.gloo` files, and inline syntax errors.

<Info>It also works with [Cursor](https://cursor.so/)!</Info>

<Warning>If you don't use the VSCode extension, you'll need to run: `gloo build` (no args) every time you edit a `.gloo` file.</Warning>



### Initialize Gloo in your project

```
gloo init
```

This will create a gloo.yaml file
