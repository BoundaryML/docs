title: "Running Tests"

To run tests on gloo, you can run pytest.

You can read more about the `-k` arg of pytest here ([PyTest Docs](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/example/markers.html#using-k-expr-to-select-tests-based-on-their-name))

```bash
# From your project root
# Runs all tests generated from @test_group
# For every function, for every variant
pytest -m gloo_test
```

To run tests for just one function
```bash
# From your project root
# Note the underscore at the end of the folder name
pytest -m gloo_test ./generated/[function_name]_
```

To run tests for just one test group
```bash
# From your project root
pytest -m gloo_test -k [test_group_name]
```

To run a specific test case in a test group
```bash
# From your project root
pytest -m gloo_test -k '[test_group_name] and [test_case_name]'
```

## Coming Soon
```bash
# From anywhere within your project
gloo test --function [function_name]
gloo test --group [test_group_name]
gloo test --group [test_group_name] --case [test_case_name]
```
